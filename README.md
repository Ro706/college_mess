# Mess Management System using PHP and MySQL

The Mess Management System is an innovative software solution designed to automate the manual process of managing mess-related activities in college hostels. This system streamlines meal planning, food ordering, inventory management, and billing. Developed using PHP as the programming language and MySQL as the database management system, the system aims to reduce the workload on mess staff, increase efficiency, and minimize errors.

## Features

1. **Menu Planning**
   - Mess staff can plan menus for the week or month, considering student preferences and dietary requirements.

2. **Food Ordering**
   - Mess staff can order raw materials from vendors and track delivery status.

3. **Inventory Management**
   - Manage inventory levels to avoid stockouts.

4. **Billing**
   - Generate bills for students based on their meal consumption.
   - Students can view their bills online.

## Implementation Details

- Agile software development methodology was used for flexibility and quick adaptation to changing requirements.
- Extensive research, interviews with mess staff, and analysis of existing manual systems were conducted during the requirements gathering stage.
- Design stage included use cases, entity-relationship diagrams, class diagrams, and sequence diagrams.
- The system was coded, integrated with the database, and thoroughly tested for errors and bugs.

## Results

- The prototype was deployed in a college hostel.
- Reduced workload on mess staff.
- Increased billing accuracy.
- Students found the system easy to use and saved time queuing for meals.
- Scalability tested successfully.

## Conclusion

The Mess Management System is a cost-effective, efficient, and user-friendly solution that automates the manual mess management process. It can be customized for different institutions and significantly reduces the workload on mess staff.
